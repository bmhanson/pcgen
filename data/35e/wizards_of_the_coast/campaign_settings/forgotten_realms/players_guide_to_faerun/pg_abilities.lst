Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Arcane Devotee ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SORTKEY:Class ~ Arcane Devotee		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Arcane Devotee Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Arcane devotees gain no proficiency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies to Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Arcane Devotee ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known			SORTKEY:Class ~ Arcane Devotee		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Arcane Devotee Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:When a new arcane devotee level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level arcane spells before he added the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the level of arcane devotee to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level arcane spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Cooperative Metamagic		KEY:Incantrix ~ Cooperative Metamagic					SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 2nd level, an incantatrix gains the ability to apply any metamagic feat she possesses (except Silent Spell, Still Spell, or Quicken Spell) to a spell being cast by a willing allied spellcaster. The caster need not prepare the spell in metamagic form or in a higher-level spell slot; the incantatrix simply modifies the spell during the casting. Using this ability is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, just like casting a spell, though the incantatrix can use the Concentration skill with this ability as though she were casting defensively. The incantatrix must ready an action to use cooperative metamagic when her ally begins casting and must be adjacent to the caster. The incantatrix must make a Spellcraft check (DC 18 + [3 x modified spell level]) to succeed. "Modified spell level" is the level of the spell slot that the spell would occupy if it were prepared with the metamagic feat applied. Any spell level increases from metamagic feats that the caster applied also count toward the modified spell level. For example, if an incantatrix applies the Maximize Spell feat to an ally's chain lightning spell, the modified spell level is 9th (6th for the spell, +1 for the Maximize Spell feat), and the DC is 18 + (3 x 9) = 45. If she applies the same feat to an ally's silent chain lightning spell, the modified spell level is 10th and the Spellcraft DC is 48. An incantatrix can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Int modifier.																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Metamagic Effect			KEY:Incantrix ~ Metamagic Effect						SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 3rd level, an incantatrix can attempt to apply a metamagic feat she possesses to a persistent spell effect that is already in place. For example, she could use Extend Spell to extend the duration of a wall of force or Maximize Spell to maximize the damage dealt by a cloudkill. To use this ability, the incantatrix must be adjacent to or within the spell effect and make a successful Spellcraft check (DC 18 + [3 x modified spell level]). "Modified spell level" is the level of the spell slot that the spell would occupy if it were prepared with the metamagic feat applied. Spell slot increases for metamagic feats that were applied to affect the spell's casting (such as Still Spell, Silent Spell, or Quicken Spell) do not count toward the modified spell level, but adjustments for metamagic that change the spell's effect (such as Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, or Widen Spell) do count. For example, applying the Extend Spell feat to a wall of fire gives it a modified spell level of 5th (4th for the spell +1 for the Extend Spell feat), so the DC would be 18 + (3 x 5) = 33. If the wall of fire had been cast with the Silent Spell feat applied, the DC is still 33, since that feat applies to the spell's casting, not its effect. On the other hand, extending an empowered wall of fire would give it a modified spell level of 7th and a Spellcraft DC of 39. An incantatrix can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Int modifier. Using this ability is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Metamagic Spell Trigger		KEY:Incantrix ~ Metamagic Spell Trigger					SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 5th level, an incantatrix gains the ability to apply a metamagic feat she possesses to the effect of a spell trigger item (generally a wand). To use this ability, she must have the appropriate item creation feat to make the spell trigger item she is using. Using metamagic spell trigger expends a number of additional charges from the item equal to the number of effective spell levels the metamagic feat would add to a spell. For example, an incantatrix can use Quicken Spell to modify a spell cast from a wand by spending 5 charges (1 + 4 additional charges for the spell slot increase). Alternatively, she can apply Empower Spell to the effect by spending 3 charges, or trigger it silently by spending 2 charges. The Still Spell feat confers no benefit when applied to a spell trigger item. An incantatrix cannot use this ability when using a spell trigger item that does not h ave charges, such as a strand of prayer beads.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Seize Concentration		KEY:Incantrix ~ Seize Concentration						SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 6th level, an incantatrix gains the ability to wrest control of a spell that requires concentration (such as implosion, major image, or summon swarm) from another spellcaster within 30 feet. If the target spellcaster is willing, this transfer of concentration occurs automatically. Otherwise, the incantatrix and the target spellcaster make an opposed caster level check. A divine spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on this check. If the incantatrix wins, she gains control of the spell for as long as she maintains concentration or until the original spell duration expires. The spell functions as though the incantatrix were the caster (even if it is a spell she cannot cast), except that any variables determined when the spell was cast (including its caster level) remain a s determined by the original c aster. The o riginal spellcaster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw allowed against it. If the incantatrix allows her concentration to lapse before the spell duration expires, the original caster may reassert control over his spell by making a successful caster level check (DC 15 + spell level). If he fails to do so, no one controls the spell.

Instant Metamagic			KEY:Incantrix ~ Instant Metamagic						SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:Once per day, a 7th-level or higher incantatrix can apply a single metamagic feat she possesses to a spell without preparing it that way beforehand (if she prepares spells) or increasing its casting time (if she does not prepare spells). Thus, a wizard's prepared spell works as if she had prepared it with the metamagic feat, but it does not use a higher-level spell slot. A sorcerer or bard's spell is cast without adjusting its casting time, but it works as if he had cast it with the metamagic feat. A 9th-level incantatrix can use this power twice per day.

Snatch Spell			KEY:Incantrix ~ Snatch Spell							SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 8th level, an incantatrix can attempt to seize control over a persistent effect created by another spellcaster. The effect must be one that does not depend on concentration but still relies on or responds to the caster's control (such as a summon monster spell or spiritual weapon, but not a wall of fire or acid fog). Furthermore, the effect (but not necessarily the spellcaster) must be within 30 feet of the incantatrix. The target spellcaster and the incantatrix make an opposed caster level check. A divine spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on this check. If the incantatrix wins, she gains control of the spell until its original duration expires. The spell functions as though the incantatrix had cast it, except that any variables determined when the spell was cast (including its caster level) remain as determined by the caster. The original caster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw allowed against it. If the spell is dismissible and the incantatrix wishes to dismiss it, she must make a second successful opposed caster level check to do so. If she fails, the spell remains in effect and control reverts to the original caster.

For example, a wizard incantatrix could prepare a quickened fireball as a 6th-level spell instead of a 7th-level spell. This benefit also applies to the incantatrix's other class abilities. Thus, the DC for using her metamagic effect or cooperative metamagic ability is reduced appropriately for the metamagic feats involved, and she spends fewer charges when using metamagic spell trigger.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the level of shadow adept to the level of whatever other spellcasting class granted him access to 3rd-level spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class that granted access to 3rd-level spells before he became a shadow adept, he must decide to which class he adds each level of shadow adept for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Shield of Shadows			KEY:Shadow Adept ~ Shield of Shadows					SORTKEY:Class ~ Shadow Adept			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Adept Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A shadow adept of at least 4th level can surround himself with a globe of purpleblack force as a standard action. This shield of shadows functions like a shield spell, granting him a +4 shield bonus to AC and absorbing magic missiles cast at him. In addition, the shield of shadows provides concealment (20%% miss chance) against melee and ranged attacks. The shadow adept can see and reach through the shield, so it does not provide cover or concealment to opponents. The shadow adept may use a shield of shadows for up to 1 round per caster level per day. This duration need not be consecutive-the shadow adept may break it up into increments as small as 1 round if he so desires. Creating or dismissing the shield of shadows is a standard action. When the shadow adept reaches 8th level, the shield also grants him spell resistance equal to 12 + his shadow adept level, as if he were under the effect of a spell resistance spell.

Shadow Double			KEY:Shadow Adept ~ Shadow Double						SORTKEY:Class ~ Shadow Adept			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Adept Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:Once per day, a 10th-level s hadow adept can use a standard action to create a double of himself woven from shadowstuff. The double has the ability scores, base AC, hit points, saves, and attack bonuses of its creator, but no equipment. (Any apparent clothing or equipment is nonfunctional.) Since it can use anything its creator can, the double can attack the creator's enemies if given a weapon or item with which to do so. Alternatively, it can function as the target of a project image spell, duplicating the creator's actions and functioning as the origin of the creator's spells when it is within his direct line of sight. Mentally commanding the double is a free action. Using it as the originator of a spell counts as an action of the sort needed to cast the spell for both the creator and the double. Causing either the creator or the double to leave the plane they share dismisses the double. The double lasts 1 round per caster level. The death of the double does not affect the shadow adept or vice versa. If its creator dies, the shadow double still lasts until its duration expires.

She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)

This bonus increases to +2 at 4th level and to +3 at 5th level. Usually, a shadow thief of Amn who has an interest in collecting followers maintains a permanent base of operations within a city, which gives her an additional +2 bonus to her Leadership score.

This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the shadow thief of Amn. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the shadow thief can flank her (and thus sneak attack her). If the shadow thief of Amn already has improved uncanny dodge, the levels from any other classes granting uncanny dodge stack for the purpose of determining the minimum rogue level required to flank her.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the level of spellguard of Silverymoon to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class that granted access to 4th-level spells before he became a spellguard of Silverymoon, he must decide to which class he adds each level of spellguard for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

As long as he has this token in his possession, he may cast conjuration (summoning) spells, evocation [fire] spells, and spells with the teleportation descriptor within the wards of Silverymoon. He may also freely use magic items that produce those effects.

Selective Spell			KEY:Spellguard of Silverymoon ~ Selective Spell				SORTKEY:Class ~ Spellguard of Silverymoon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Spellguard of Silverymoon Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:Spellguards are specifically trained to minimize collateral damage when casting their combat spells. Once per day per point of Intelligence bonus (minimum once per day), a spellguard o f at least 3 rd level may d esignate a s ingle type (and subtype, if desired) of creature when casting a spell. When a single creature type has multiple subtypes, the spellguard may choose to count only one of the subtypes or all of them, at his discretion. At the spellguard's option, that type of creature is either the only type affected by the spell or the only type unaffected by it. Inorganic material, objects, and anything else that does not have a creature type i s affected normally. Casting a selective spell requires a fullround action. For example, suppose a spellguard is patrolling the forest around Silverymoon with a p arty o f Knights in S ilver made up o f two humans, an elf, and a dwarf. Suddenly, the group is rushed by goblins. The spellguard uses his selective spell ability to cast a fireball, designating humanoid (goblinoid) as the only creature type affected. The fireball detonates in the midst of the melee, and although the spellguard's companions are within the area of the spell, they are spared any ill effects. At 5th level, the spellguard may designate multiple creature types and subtypes for a s elective spell. Each type o r subtype so designated, however, uses up one additional use per day of his selective spell ability.

Though that purpose has largely become secondary to defending the city, spellguards still receive some training in serving as bodyguards. At 4th level, the spellguard of Silverymoon may cast any personal-range defensive arcane spell on another character with a touch.

# Zhentarim Spy
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Zhentarim spies are proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields. Armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies to Swim checks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Cover Identity			KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Cover Identity						SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A Zhentarim spy is rigorously trained to establish nearly flawless cover identities. For every distinct Craft or Profession skill in which she has at least 2 ranks, she may have one cover identity. Each cover identity must be a specific person (such as "Jolan Turnbuckle, bread-baker for the town of Shadowdale"), not a generic description (such as "baker"). She may at any time end an existing cover identity and establish a new one in its place. While operating under any of her cover identities, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks. For each additional 2 ranks (beyond the minimum 2) that the Zhentarim spy possesses in a cover identity's associated Craft or Profession skill, each of these bonuses increases by 1. At the DM's discretion, these bonuses may be reduced or eliminated in regions where the cover identity would seem out of place (bakers from Shadowdale, for example, would attract suspicion in the ruins of Myth Drannor). Establishing a new cover identity or replacing an old one means the Zhentarim spy must acquire documentation and personal effects, establish a place of business, and otherwise set up a believable second life. This process takes 1d4 tendays, during which she may do nothing else, and costs 6d10 gp. The Zhentarim spy does not need to set up a cover identity immediately for every Craft or Profession skill in which she has 2 ranks; she may wait until a good opportunity presents itself if desired. For example, she might wish to hold a cover identity option in reserve to take advantage of the unlikely cover class ability (see below). The cover identity ability does not provide any additional skills that might be necessary to make a cover identity believable, such as knowledge of the proper homeland, the ability to speak a foreign language, spellcasting ability, or the like. Thus, Zhentarim spies generally pick cover identities that complement their existing skills.																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.78

Unlikely Cover			KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Unlikely Cover						SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 3rd level, the Zhentarim spy may designate a number of cover identities equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum one) as "unlikely covers." In such a cover identity, she is disguised as someone drastically different from herself-a member of the opposite sex or a different race, or someone with a very different body shape. She may need to spend the time to establish new cover identities if she does not have any appropriate identities available. While she operates in an unlikely cover, her normal bonuses on Disguise, Bluff, and Gather Information checks for a cover identity are doubled (to +8 on Disguise checks, +4 on Bluff and Gather Information checks, and +2 per 2 extra ranks on checks made with the cover identity's Craft or Profession skill). Furthermore, the DC for Spot checks made to penetrate her disguise increases by 4.

These may be the same cover identities selected for the unlikely cover ability, or they may be different ones, or they may be a mixture o f both. Unlike h er unlikely cov er i dentities, however, the identities she selects for deep cover need not be new. When the Zhentarim spy is operating within one of her deep cover identities, her mind is so thoroughly trained and conditioned to think like the person she pretends to be that any magical scrying or mind reading at a power level short of deific reveals nothing about her true nature. Only the thoughts, alignment, and emotions of the fictitious persona can be detected.
