SOURCEPAGE:p.137
Sneak Attack (Ex)			KEY:Sneak Attack ~ Naztharune			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Naztharune Race Trait.SpecialAttack	SERVESAS:ABILITY=Special Ability|Sneak Attack			DESC:If a naztharune rakshasa can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from its attack, it can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

The naztharune rakshasa's sneak attack ability is equivalent to that of a rogue of a level equal to the creature's Hit Dice.
