However, he can ignore the 1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks associated with that negative level for 2 minutes, since his Constitution bonus is +2.

ADDSPELLLEVEL:2					SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that any creature subject to fear effects and mind-affecting spells and abilities that is dealt damage also becomes shaken for 1 minute.

You cast these spells like any other spell you can cast, once you host a mother cyst (if you are a caster who prepares spells, you can prepare all necrotic cyst spells without referring to a spellbook, as if you had the Spell Mastery feat for each such spell).

On days when you have created a reserve, you are weakened but not destroyed when you are dealt enough damage to reduce your hit points to 0 or lower. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can it take full-round actions). It moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesnt risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) immediately expends the necrotic reserve. Unless the action increased the weakened undeads hit points, it is destroyed. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve is also destroyed if it is dealt additional damage after the attack that first weakened it.
Necropotent				TYPE:General																																				PRECLASS:1,Fighter=4		PREFEAT:1,Weapon Specialization																																																													DESC:Your special melee or ranged attack with one type of weapon is especially effective against undead.

The spell remains in your mind for up to 1 hour. You can have a maximum number of stolen spells equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1); any spells that you would gain above this number are simply lost. This feat has no effect on spellcasters who dont prepare spells (such as a sorcerer, who simply loses one spell slot for each negative level bestowed as normal) or who have no spells prepared (such as a fighter, or a wizard who has cast all her spells).
Spurn Death's Touch		TYPE:Divine			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Turn Undead																																																																																																DESC:You can channel divine energy to remove some of the harmful effects of attacks made by undead creatures.

You can only use this effect to heal ability damage dealt by an undead creature or remove effects caused by an undead creature.
Stitched Flesh Familiar		TYPE:General																																																																							PRESA:1,Summon Familiar							PRESPELLSCHOOL:3,Necromancy=0																						DESC:When you are ready and able to acquire a new familiar, you may choose to gain a stitched flesh familiar.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:When choosing a familiar, you may choose a stitched flesh familiar. A stitched flesh familiar appears similar to any of the standard familiars available in the Players Handbook, except that the stitched flesh familiar is obviously sewn together from many different creatures of that kind and, to a practiced eye, is clearly an undead creature. A stitched flesh familiar is magically linked to its master in the same way as a normal familiar. A stitched flesh familiar uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual, except as noted below. Hit Dice: A stitched flesh familiar has a d12 Hit Die and gains no bonus hit points from Constitution (since it is an undead creature). For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the masters character level or the familiars normal Hit Dice total, whichever is higher. Hit Points: Use 1/2 the masters total or the familiars normal total, whichever is higher. Attacks: Use the masters base attack bonus or the familiars, whichever is higher. Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use either the familiars base save bonus or the masters (as calculated from his character level), whichever is higher. Familiar Special Abilities: Use the second table in the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Players Handbook to determine additional abilities, just as you would for a normal familiar. Stitched flesh familiars do not grant their masters any of the benefits that appear on the first table in that sidebar. Instead of the noted special ability, a stitched flesh familiar grants its master the ability to control 4 more Hit Dice of undead than he is normally capable of controlling (both through the rebuke undead ability and through spells such as animate dead).
Tomb-Born Fortitude		TYPE:General																								PREALIGN:LN,LE,TN,NE,CN,CE													PREFEAT:1,Tomb Tainted Soul																																																														DESC:The power of undeath taints you, body and soul. Its power has hardened your flesh and given it the foul look of the grave.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:You have a 25%% chance to resist critical hits. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against you, there is a 25%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. In addition, you do not risk death from massive damage. Your skin takes on the pallor and texture of a dead creature of your race.
Tomb-Born Resilience		TYPE:General																								PREALIGN:LN,LE,TN,NE,CN,CE													PREFEAT:1,Tomb Tainted Soul																																																														DESC:The power of undeath taints you, deadening your mind and body to the effects of mindcontrolling magic, poison, and disease.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, and disease. Your nails or claws grow yellow and rotten. Although this change has no effect on the damage of your unarmed or natural attacks, most individuals find such creatures horrid-looking
Tomb-Born Vitality		TYPE:General																								PREALIGN:LN,LE,TN,NE,CN,CE													PREFEAT:1,Tomb Tainted Soul																																																														DESC:The power of undeath taints you, body and soul. Its power has removed your need to sleep and eat.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:You do not need to sleep, and you are immune to magic sleep effects.

SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:You attract followers and a cohort as if you had taken the Leadership feat. Your leadership score is treated as 2 higher than it otherwise would be for the purposes of attracting undead followers and treated as 4 lower than it otherwise would be for the purposes of attracting living followers.
